# Monster Hunter Freedom Unite Upscale Project (english)

This is an texture upscaling project for Monster Hunter Freedom Unite ULUS10391 (US version) for the PSP Emulator, [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/).  Please feel free to take anything from this project and use anywhere you like, no credit is due, or help improve this project!

## Description

I'm a README noob so please excus the mess.   For the most part, this is pretty fresh build.  About 95% of the textures in this project are straight upscales using different models in [Cupscale](https://github.com/n00mkrad/cupscale).  The other 5% of textures were replacements of my own mixed in with some really good UI, area and environment textures from [MHFURemaster-VakSan](https://github.com/Klara-nihk/MHFURemaster-VakSan), really just an utter fantastic job!!!  The original owner of those textures went far beyond basic upscaling but I wanted a look closer resembling the original game, so I used basic texture upscaling tools for most areas and used others from MHFURemaster-VakSan to make it look nicer.

## Asset Size

Armor, Weapons, Characters and Monsters are all upscaled at 8X original size.  All other assets as 4X original size.

## Progress

I am HR6 so I haven't been able to reach the HR7 and higher G-Ranked monsters to dump their textures, but I used the cheats on a secondary game and unlocked as much as I could. I tried to purchase and upgrade everything I could, but some items require items that not available in an all-items cheat. Here are my current estimates on where I think the progress is:

* UI: 100% of meaningful elements.  Also replaced PS buttons with X-Box buttons.
* Armor: 95% Female, 85% Male ...these took a VERY long time to do
* Weapons: 95% Female, 85% Male
* Areas: 100%, this includes the "old" versions of levels, ei: "old desert"
* Characters: 100%, I believe I ran through every possible combination of characters during the creation process
* Monsters: 95%, from what I've seen from the other repository, I've got nearly all but a few remaining

Again, this is all an estimate but seems to be in line with where I am in the game.

### Installing

* Download and extract the "ULUS10391" folder in the PSP/TEXTURES folder.
* If the TEXTURES folder does not exist, create it in the same directory where you see the COMMON, GAME, and SAVEDATA folders.
* In the PPSSPP emulator, go to SETTINGS -> TOOLS -> DEVELOPER TOOLS
* Under Texture Replacement, make sure the "Replace textures" box is checked.
* If you device allows, turn on the Post-Processing Shader to FXAA Antialiasing.  This is just a personal preference.

### Help Wanted

I would love for this project to be perfected, so please reach out if you want to be a contributor to this project.
